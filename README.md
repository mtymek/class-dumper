Usage
-----

### Commandline script

First, create configuration file that lists all files you want to merge. You don't need 
to worry about class order, nor about adding required interfaces or parent classes - they 
will be added automatically to merged file. 

Config file is simple PHP file, returning array of class names:
 
```php
// config/classes-to-cache.php
return [
    // ZF2 classes
    Zend\Mvc\Application::class,
    Zend\Mvc\ApplicationInterface::class,
    Zend\EventManager\EventsCapableInterface::class,
   
    // custom classes
    Foo\Application::class,
    Foo\Listener\Auth::class    
]
```
 
Next, use `dump-classes.php` script to generate cached file: 

```bash
php ./vendor/bin/dump-classes.php config/classes-to-cache.php data/cache/classes.php.cache
```

When class cache is generated, you can include it in your application entry point: 

```php
// index.php
include 'vendor/autoload.php';
include 'data/cache/classes.php.cache';
```

You can automate generation using `composer` by adding post-install and post-update hooks
to `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "post-install-cmd": [
            "php ./vendor/bin/dump-classes.php config/classes-to-cache.php data/cache/classes.php.cache-raw",
        ],
        "post-update-cmd": [
            "php ./vendor/bin/dump-classes.php config/classes-to-cache.php data/cache/classes.php.cache-raw",
        ]
    }
}
```

### PHP

Alternatively, cached class file can be generated in your PHP script:

```php
$dumper = new ClassDumper();
$cache = $dumper->dump([
    Foo::class,
    Bar::class,
]);
file_put_contents('data/cache/class_cache', "<?php\n" . $cache);
```

### Minifing merged file

ClassDumper can reduce size of emitted file by stripping all whitespace and comments.

It can be triggered from commandline by adding `--strip` switch:

 ```bash
php ./vendor/bin/dump-classes.php config/classes-to-cache.php classes.php.cache --strip
```
 
Using in PHP:
 
```php
$cache = $dumper->dump([ /* ... */ ], true);
```

### Generating config files

You can easily generate configuration file based on currently included files in your application.
In order to do it, add following lines after your application bootstrap (ideally somewhere before 
routing starts):

```php
$configGenerator = new \ClassDumper\ConfigGenerator;
$configGenerator->dumpIncludedClasses('config.php');
```

This will save list of all included classes into `config.php` file. You may want to edit configuration 
file manually before using it in your application - see "Limitations" section below.
After creating the config file, remove above lines.


Limitations
-----------

Not every class can be cached using `Class Dumper`. 

* class dump will end up in different directory than merged classes. Classes using constants 
like `__DIR__`or `__FILE__` will likely not work correctly.
* when using with "--strip" options, all comments - including annotations - will be stripped 
out. This will prevent annotation parser from working, if used on cached classes.

TODO
----

* throw exception when class does not exist
* warn if class contains `__DIR__` or `__FILE__` constants
* output/log statistics
* fix `__DIR__` constants
